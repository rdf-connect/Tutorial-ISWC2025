We plan a full day for this tutorial as shown in [](#planning).
The morning session will focus on the basics of Solid and Comunica,
and the afternoon will consist of hands-on sessions for building applications.
We expect participants to have basic knowledge of Web technologies such as HTML, JavaScript, RDF and SPARQL.
