## Abstract
<!-- Context -->
[RDF Connect](https://github.com/rdf-connect/) emerges as a groundbreaking solution to the fragmented landscape of data processing pipelines, offering a language-agnostic framework for building sophisticated, provenance-aware streaming data transformations.
<!-- Need -->
In an era of increasingly complex data ecosystems and the growing importance of Large Language Models (LLMs), developers and researchers require flexible, interoperable tools for creating multilingual data processing pipelines.
<!-- Task -->
To address this critical need, we present a comprehensive, hands-on tutorial designed to empower participants with the skills to leverage RDF Connect's innovative capabilities.
<br class='screen-only' />
<!-- Object -->
The tutorial provides an immersive, full-day learning experience that combines theoretical insights with practical implementation. Participants will: (i) Construct a machine learning pipeline using processors in multiple programming languages, (ii) Create custom data processors for diverse endpoints, (iii) Explore provenance tracking using RDF and PROV-O ontology.
<!-- Conclusion -->
By the end of the tutorial, participants from varied backgrounds—including Python, JavaScript, and Java developers—will gain practical experience in building language-agnostic, semantically rich data processing pipelines.
<!-- Perspectives -->
This tutorial not only introduces RDF Connect but also opens new avenues for interdisciplinary data transformation strategies in semantic web research and development.
