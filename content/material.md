## Material
{:#material}

The tutorial is guided by slides,
which are shared online.
For the hands-on coding sessions, we provide
a git repository with separate branches for all sequentially completed tasks.
This will allow participants that are unable to complete a certain task,
to still begin with the next task by checking out a different branch.

The slides and git repository are open for everyone under the CC BY 4.0 license.

### Requirements

* [git](https://git-scm.com/) (*you probably already have this*)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (>= 10.0)
* A JavaScript editor. (we will use [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/), but feel free to use anything you want)
