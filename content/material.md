## Material
{:#material}

The tutorial is guided by slides, which are shared online.
For the hands-on coding sessions, we provide a git repository with separate branches for all sequentially completed tasks.
This will allow participants that are unable to complete a certain task,
to still begin with the next task by checking out a different branch.

The slides and git repository are open for everyone under the CC BY 4.0 license.
