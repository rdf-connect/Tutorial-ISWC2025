## Material
{:#material}

The tutorial is guided by a set of [Web slides](https://rdf-connect.github.io/Tutorial-ISWC2025/slides/).
For the hands-on coding sessions, we provide a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rdf-connect/nara-weather-forecast-kg-pipeline) with separate branches for all sequentially completed tasks.
This will allow participants that are unable to complete a certain task,
to still begin with the next task by checking out the corresponding branch.
The [RDF-Connect website](https://rdf-connect.github.io/) offers an overview and links towards different complementary resources, such as the [online specification](https://rdf-connect.github.io/specification/) which provides a detailed technical description.
The slides, specification and Github repository are open for everyone under the CC BY 4.0 license.
